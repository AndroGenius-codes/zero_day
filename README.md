**First Repository**
I created this project by:
1.Creating a repository on [github.com]
2.creating a directory on my local machine
3.initializing git in that local directory and adding the remote origin by typing `git remote add origin https://github.com/UserName/zero_day.git`
4.created a README file 
5.commited and pushed my project to github using `git commit -m "message"` and `git push` respectively
